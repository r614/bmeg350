# What is this?

A small exploration I did for BMEG 350 (Human Physiology), trying to find a way to compare neutral density target motion in in-vivo ferrets and human cadavers.  

# How should I run this?

Install the requirements using `pip install -r requirements.txt` 

Walk through the notebook, a large part of it is undocumented but it essentially tries to use different curve fitting approaches to model the 3 dimensional 
(technically 2 dimensional, because we only had access to figures from the paper) motion of the NDT
